# Multi Dict

Smart language detection spell checker with configurable text highlights, customisable shortcuts

Supported languages are based on the dictionaries used for spell checking in Chrome, Firefox,
LibreOffice, OpenOffice, and many more apps that rely on the Hunspell spell checker.

## Usage

### Disabling Built In Spellchecker

The spell checking part of this extension is essentially a JavaScript only version of Hunspell, the
exact spell checker used by Firefox in the first place, and it employs the same default
dictionaries. So you can trust the add-on to do all the spell checking for you and behave the way
you expect it would.

To prevent double reports and conflicts please disable the built-in spell checker:

1. open up Firefox and type `about:preferences` into the URL bar
2. scroll down the page and uncheck the "Check your spelling as you type" checkbox

### Enabling Multi Language Spell Checking

To enable spell checking for multiple languages:

1. open up Firefox and type `about:preferences` into the URL bar
2. scroll down the page and click the `Choose` button next to
   "Choose your preferred language for displaying pages"
3. add your desired languages by choosing the "Select a language to add" checkbox

### How It Works: Spell Checking Language Preference

The extension will detect which language is being used inside editable elements on the page and try
to match that to one of your supported languages. If it can't find a match or cannot reliably detect
the language it will default to your primary preferred language.

Let's take a look at a slightly complex example and go through it step by step:

1. you add the Australian English (en-au), American English (en-us), and standard German (de-de)
   languages to your Firefox preferred languages list via Firefox preferences pane in that order

2. you write the sentence 'Ich leibe mein leben' as the subject of an email
   - Multi Dict will detect the language as German (de) and attempt to match it like so: de-au
   - no match is found, so the next language in your preferred language list is checked: de-us
   - no match is found, so the next language in your preferred language list is checked: de-de
   - a match with a preferred language is found which matches the subject text field language, so
     Multi Dict will use the German dictionary to spell check and offer suggestions for `leibe`
     (which should be spelt `liebe`)

3. you write the text "Such beautiful colours! Colorful days are great!" as the body of the email
   - Multi Dict will detect the language as English (en) and attempt to match it like so: en-au
   - a match with a preferred language is found which matches the subject text field language
   - because Australian English has a higher preference than American English according to your
     preferences, Multi Dict will use Australian English to spell check, and offer suggestions for
     `Colorful` (which is misspelt in Australian English and missing a "u")

This way you can use multiple dictionaries on the same page/tab without changing any preferences or
using any hotkeys. It is especially useful if you are used to composing emails in multiple
languages.

> Note that your first specified language is also your default language and is used when no matches
can be found, so if you are editing content in French and (for whatever reason) this is not on your
supported languages list, in the above example, spell checking would be done against Australian
English.

## Privacy

_No information is_ ___ever___ _collected by this add-on or sent to any 3rd party._

It should be noted, however, that the native Firefox [detect language][8] feature is a JavaScript
wrapper around the Compact Language Detector software [CLD2][9] and I cannot say for sure that when
calling this method, Firefox isn't sending data to it's servers.

I can say that there doesn't seem to be any requests being made inside the Network tab of the
developer tools when calling this function and that Mozilla has a very to-the-point, down-to-earth
[privacy policy][10] which details their philosophy and approach to data collection.

Remember, Firefox is open source software, which makes them a damn sight more trustworthy and
accountable than most other companies (and certainly most other browsers) out in the wild, if you
have the skills and time you could also poke around their code base yourself just to make
absolutely sure (or you could proxy all your own web traffic and try to isolate any and all network
traffic coming from Firefox).
